Overview
--------

Lightpile is a tool to simulate dipole emitters in thin film stacks.
This is a physics problem involving eletromagnetism and a bit of quantum
mechanics. You might be interested in using Lightpile if working in the field
of (organic) light emitting devices, known as (O)LEDs, or quantum dots.
