"""
Emitters and ensembles of emitters.

The OrientedEmitter is the building block for all kind of ensembles. It is
treated as a single two-level-system with stochastic decay mechanisms and
therefore cannibalistic decay channels (propability for a specific decay
channel depends on the optical environment). Every oriented emitter has an
internal quantum efficiency describing the strength of internal decay for the
unperturbed emitter in vacuum. The real quantum efficiency is determined by
the optical environment.

In contrary the ensembles (SpectralEnsemble, SpatialEnsemble) are collections
of dipole emitters with fixed propabilities (relative Anteilsh√§ufigkeit)
independent of the optical environment.
