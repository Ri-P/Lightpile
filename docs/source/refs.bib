@article{Polerecky00,
abstract = {A rigorous theory of radiation from dipoles embedded inside an arbitrary multilayer system is presented. In particular, we derive explicit expressions for the angular distribution of the electromagnetic field and the intensity radiated by the dipole into the surrounding media. Under the assumptions of mutual incoherence of the dipole radiation the calculations are extended to a layer of radiating dipoles. Special configurations corresponding to (i) a single dipole near a dielectric interface, (ii) a dipole layer surrounded by semi-infinite dielectric media, and (iii) a dipole layer placed on top of a waveguide layer are discussed in detail. This theoretical analysis has important consequences for the optimization of optical chemical sensors and biosensors that are based on fluorescence emission.},

@article{Deparis2011,
abstract = {In spite of the fact that solutions to Maxwell's equations in stratified isotropic optical media are well known, it appears that an explicit expression of the Poynting vector flux spatial evolution inside such a medium has not been derived so far. Based on exact electromagnetic field solutions in the transfer-matrix formalism, I derive such an expression and show that, due to the presence of counterpropagating waves in the medium, an additional contribution to the flux appears that exists only in optically absorbing layers and arises from the interference between these waves. Based on this theory, the concept of incremental absorption is introduced for the calculation of the light absorption profile along the stratification direction. As an illustration of this concept, absorption profiles in a Si-based thin-film tandem solar cell are predicted at typical wavelengths.},
